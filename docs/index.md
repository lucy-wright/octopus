## About me

I am a **PhD research student** in Geophysics, based in the School of Earth Sciences at the **University of Bristol**. I'm interested in planetary atmospheres in our solar system and beyond.

I'm currently analysing infrared spectra acquired by [NASA/ESA/ASI's Cassini-Huygens mission](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/overview/) to investigate the atmosphere of Saturn's largest moon, Titan.

I'm supervised by Dr Nick Teanby. My PhD is funded by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC).

I also enjoy playing water polo.
